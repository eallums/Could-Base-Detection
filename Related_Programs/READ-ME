Greetings,

This document, alongside the TSI_LES mock-paper, will direct the user to develop TSI images based on the LES fields. 

The script below will allow for console like submission of the blender job:

cd  "LES_TSI Directory"
blender Cloudmapperv1.0.blend -b -P Cloud2Blenderv1.0.py


Note:
	-b tells blender to run without GUI ( or --background)
	-P tells blender to run the python script following it (or --python)

You will, however, need to first modify the Cloud2Blenderv1.0.py to point the program to the proper folder and dump location.
